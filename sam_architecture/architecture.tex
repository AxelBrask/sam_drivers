\begin{abstract}
This is a design document intended to guide the development
of the software architecture for the SMARC SAM AUV.
We detail the interface of the hardware components to the
software stack, and propose an interface between
the basic software components. The design document
is accompanied by implementations of several of the
proposed components, as found in the repository
\texttt{gitr.sys.kth.se/smarc-project/sam\_drivers}.
\end{abstract}

%\section{Hardware Overview}

\section{Architecture Overview}
\label{overview}

The SAM AUV platform is designed to use two identical ARM processors as its main computers.
These will be referred to as the \textit{base} and \textit{science} computers respectively.
In this document we are mainly concerned with the software architecture on the \textit{base}
computer, and any discussion refers to that unless otherwise mentioned.
The base computer communicates with sensors and actuators (henceforth referred to as \textit{devices})
via the CAN bus protocol. Attached to most devices are \textit{Teensy} microcontrollers, which
handle the interfacing with the CAN bus network. The microcontrollers are also responsible for
synching the time of all devices to that of the computers.

\section{ROS Middleware}
\label{ros}

\textit{The Robot Operating System} (ROS)\footnote{\texttt{https://ros.org/}} is a so called \textit{middleware}, that allows different processes on
a computer or network to communicate with each other in different ways.
It also provides ways of organizing and running software. ROS allows the transmission of data types,
called ROS \textit{messages}, between components via a publisher/subscriber model.
A large collection of message types are already
provided through the ROS software distribution, but you may also define new message types.
The advantage of using provided or standardized message types is that the ROS community
already provides tools for operating on many of these types,
and that you can display them in the \textit{Rviz} visualization tool.

\section{UAVCAN Protocol}
\label{uavcan}

UAVCAN\footnote{\texttt{https://uavcan.org/}} is a high-level protocol defined on top of CAN bus. It allows for easy and robust
communication of data types over a CAN bus network. Similar to ROS, UAVCAN defines its
own message types, and also allows the user to extend the system with user-defined message types.
UAVCAN \textit{nodes} are responsible for transmitting and receiving messages over the network.
They may run both on full-fledged processors such as that of the base computer, or on microcontrollers.
UAVCAN also provides tools for synching the time of the attached nodes.

\section{Components}
\label{components}

\subsection{Devices \& Teensys}

As stated the Section \ref{overview}, most sensor and actuators are hooked up to a Teensy microcontroller.
The microcontrollers all provide a UAVCAN node that may provide both subscribe and publish
functionality, depending on the capabilities of the attached device.
Note that ROS and UAVCAN messages, while similar, can not be defined in a way
as to be shared between the two. To get data from the Teensys into the ROS middleware
on the base computer, we therefore need to define an interoperability layer.

\subsection{uavcan\_ros\_bridge}
\label{bridge}

\begin{sidewaysfigure*}
\include{img/sam_architecture}
\caption{Overview of the base SAM AUV dataflow, with message types detailed.
         The Section of the components are indicated next to the labels.
         Note the orange line next to the base sensors and actuators.
         It indicates that each component is connected to the CAN network
         via a Teensy microcontroller, see Section \ref{bridge}.}
\label{system_figure}
\end{sidewaysfigure*}

The interoperability layer between ROS and UAVCAN is called \textit{uavcan\_ros\_bridge}\footnote{\texttt{gitr.sys.kth.se/smarc-project/sam\_drivers/\\tree/master/uavcan\_ros\_bridge}}.
It is divided into two parts, one that converts UAVCAN messages into ROS messages and
one that converts ROS messages into UAVCAN. This division is motivated by the way the
ROS and UAVCAN event loops are implemented. Specifically, in the case of the UAVCAN to
ROS bridge, the event loop is driven by UAVCAN, and a function to publish a ROS message
is triggered every time a UAVCAN message is received. The other way is driven by the ROS
event loop in a similar manner. The division minimizes delay in the propagation of messages.

In effect we would like a direct translation between the message types of UAVCAN and ROS.
However, the specification of the messages differ on a few points\footnote{\texttt{github.com/tum-phoenix/drive\_ros\_uavcan/README.md }}.
Luckily, all of these differences can easily be avoided by using the following convention
when translating a message in either direction.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Variable size int types of UAVCAN}: always use the next largest int size in ROS.
\item \textbf{ROS topic names}: ROS allows publishing on topics. The topic names should be defined statically in the bridge node.
\item \textbf{UAVCAN node id recipients}: UAVCAN supports recipients being specified in a message. These should be defined statically in the bridge node.
\end{itemize}
With these workarounds, any types on either side can always be translated to a suitable
type and message on the other side via the bridge.

To convert a UAVCAN message to ROS you need to write a conversion
function. The procedure is the same as for conversions in the
other direction. The conversion function for the IMU messages
might look as follows.
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
template <>
bool convert(
    const uavcan::equipment::ahrs::RawIMU& uav_msg,
    sensor_msgs::Imu& ros_msg)
{
    ros_msg.header.stamp =
        convert_timestamp(uav_msg.timestamp);
    ros_msg.linear_acceleration.x =
        uav_msg.accelerometer_latest[0];
    ros_msg.linear_acceleration.y =
        uav_msg.accelerometer_latest[1];
    ros_msg.linear_acceleration.z =
        uav_msg.accelerometer_latest[2];
    ros_msg.angular_velocity.x =
        uav_msg.rate_gyro_latest[0];
    ros_msg.angular_velocity.y =
        uav_msg.rate_gyro_latest[1];
    ros_msg.angular_velocity.z =
        uav_msg.rate_gyro_latest[2];
    return true;
}
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}
It converts the timestamp, as provided by the Teensy,
and sets the values of all the ROS members to the corresponding
UAVCAN values. In addition, we need to add the following
line in \texttt{uavcan\_to\_ros\_bridge.cpp}.
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
uav_to_ros::ConversionServer<
    uavcan::equipment::ahrs::RawIMU,
    sensor_msgs::Imu>
    server(uav_node, ros_node, "uavcan_imu");
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}
The string \texttt{"uavcan\_imu"} tells the program where to
publish the produced ROS topic. With this, the \texttt{ConversionServer}
interface will take care of subscribing to the correct UAVCAN topics
and publish a message to ROS every time a new message is received.

\subsection{ROS Sensor Interfaces}
\label{sensors}

Whenever possible, we should use the standard ROS messages
to represent the data flowing between components.
For simple sensors, there are for the most part suitable
message types available. In the case of more complex sensors,
and particular the sonar sensors in the SAM AUV, we will
have to implement our own data types. The exact interface
of these types will be decided when the sensors are available, and
we have drivers to inspect the presented data.
For the base sensors, we propose using the following messages.
\subsubsection{IMU}

\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{sensor\_msgs/Imu}
\item[topic] \texttt{/imu}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Magnetometer}

\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{sensor\_msgs/MagneticField}
\item[topic] \texttt{/magnetic\_field}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{GPS Fix} 

\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{sensor\_msgs/NavSatFix}
\item[topic] \texttt{/gps\_fix}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Pressure} 

\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{sensor\_msgs/FluidPressure}
\item[topic] \texttt{/pressure}
\end{description}

\subsection{ROS Actuator Interfaces}

Similarly, the actuators of an AUV are specific to the hardware.
Since we already know the interface of the actuators, we
have prototyped message definitions in the \texttt{sam\_msgs}
repository\footnote{\texttt{https://gitr.sys.kth.se/smarc-project/\\sam\_drivers/tree/master/sam\_msgs}}.
We propose the following data types.
\subsubsection{Thruster RPM}

\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{sam\_msgs/ThrusterRPMs}
\item[topic] \texttt{/thruster\_rpms}
\item[contents] \begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
 int32 thruster_1_rpm
 int32 thruster_2_rpm
 std_msgs/Header header
   uint32 seq
   time stamp
   string frame_id
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Thruster Angles}

\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{sam\_msgs/ThrusterAngles}
\item[topic] \texttt{/thruster\_angles}
\item[contents] \begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
 float32 thruster_vertical_radians
 float32 thruster_horizontal_radians
 std_msgs/Header header
   uint32 seq
   time stamp
   string frame_id
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Ballast Angles}

\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{sam\_msgs/BallastAngles}
\item[topic] \texttt{/thruster\_angles}
\item[contents] \begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
 float32 weight_1_offset_radians
 float32 weight_2_offset_radians
 std_msgs/Header header
   uint32 seq
   time stamp
   string frame_id
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Longitudinal weight position} 

\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{sam\_msgs/PercentStamped}
\item[topic] \texttt{/longitudinal\_weight\_position}
\item[contents] \begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
 float32 percent
 std_msgs/Header header
   uint32 seq
   time stamp
   string frame_id
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Buoyancy piston position}

\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{sam\_msgs/PercentStamped}
\item[topic] \texttt{/buoyancy\_piston\_position}
\end{description}

\subsection{ROS TF Interface}
\label{tf}

ROS uses the TF library \footnote{\texttt{http://wiki.ros.org/tf}} to represent
the geometric state of the world, i.e. the transforms between different parts.
In our case, we will likely have at least three notable transform frames,
\texttt{/world} - the global refereece frame,
\texttt{/base\_link} - the position of the AUV center of rotation,
\texttt{/odom} - the dead reckoning reference frame.
The dead reckoning and SLAM systems produce different transforms within
this structure. DR produces high-frequency estimates of the \texttt{/base\_link}
pose in the \texttt{/odom} reference frame. Meanwhile, SLAM produces lower
frequency corrections to this transform by publishing the transform
between \texttt{/world} and \texttt{/odom}. The TF transform server takes
care of synchronizing these transforms, and provides us with
full transforms between \texttt{/world} and \texttt{/base\_link}
at the frequency of DR. This also means that we can run with
purely based on DR if there is no SLAM correction available.

\subsubsection{Dead Reckoning}
\label{dr}

\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{TF transformation}
\item[topic] \texttt{/tf}
\item[frames] \texttt{/odom -> /base\_link}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{SLAM}
\label{mapping}

\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{TF transformation}
\item[topic] \texttt{/tf}
\item[frames] \texttt{/world -> /odom}
\end{description}

\subsection{Motion Planner Interface}
\label{planner}

The motion planner discussed here is the one used for
traversing distances under water. There may also be
other planners and controllers e.g. for hovering or
for ascent/descent. We mainly have two ways of commanding
the AUV to move. First, we may give it a pose in
the global reference frame, i.e. \texttt{/world}.
We may also give it a heading that it will follow.
In both cases, we need to supply a target depth of
the AUV that it should try to stay at. In both cases,
we will use the \texttt{z} component of the messages
for this purpose. We propose that if \texttt{z} has a
negative value, it refers to the target depth below
the sea floor. In instead \texttt{z} is positive, it
should be interpreted as the target altitude (height above seafloor).
In addition, there are safe altitudes and depths to take
into account when planning, see below.

\subsubsection{Parameters}

The motion planner interface uses both ROS topics and ROS parameters.
Parameters can be set by any ROS node and also accessed by any node.
In particular, the motion planner should take into account the following parameters.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Safe altitude} the motion planner should always try to stay above this height over the sea floor \begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{double}
\item[name] \texttt{/safe\_altitude}
\end{description}
\item \textbf{Safe depth} the motion planner should always try to stay above this water depth \begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{double}
\item[name] \texttt{/safe\_depth}
\end{description}  
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Topics}

% here we will require several types of goals,
% like on the Hugin. These may be one of the following:
% 1. 2D Pose + Depth/Altitude (positive z indicate altitude control, negative z indicate depth control?)
% (what if we want both?) - these should be parameters, i.e. safe altitude/depth
% 2. Heading + Depth/Altitude -> could this be converted into a pose instead (automatically) ?
% 3. Hover + Depth/Altitude -> we can't really convert this into a trajectory, so scrap this
% Can we get this 

The proposed topic to specify a trajectory are defined as follows.
It can either be a heading,
\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{sam\_msgs/HeadingStamped}
\item[topic] \texttt{/nav\_heading}
\item[contents] \begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
 float64 heading
 # depth if negative,
 # altitude if positive
 float64 z
 std_msgs/Header header
   uint32 seq
   time stamp
   string frame_id
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{description}
or a pose in the \texttt{/world} frame,
\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{geometry\_msgs/PoseStamped}
\item[topic] \texttt{/nav\_goal}
\item[contents] \begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
 std_msgs/Header header
   uint32 seq
   time stamp
   string frame_id
 geometry_msgs/Pose pose
   geometry_msgs/Point position
     float64 x
     float64 y
     # depth if negative,
     # altitude if positive
     float64 z 
   geometry_msgs/Quaternion orientation
     float64 x
     float64 y
     float64 z
     float64 w
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{description}
The motion planner then produces a message of type \texttt{nav\_msgs/Path}
(see the next section). The path represents a realistic motion
trajectory of the AUV, that can be followed by a controller algorithm.
The rationale for using a \texttt{nav\_msgs/Path} for both kinds
of goals (way point and heading) is two-fold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It minimizes development overhead
\item We still need a 3D path in the z-axis, to keep the desired depth or altitude
\end{enumerate}
We anticipate that this will work well in our scenario, since
the planner is expected to run every few seconds.

\subsection{Controller Interface}
\label{controller}

The controller subscribes to the path from the previous
section, together with the transform between \texttt{/world}
and \texttt{/base\_link}, as provided by the TF server.
It then tries to control the actuators of the vehicle
to follow the desired path. Note that the controller may be
separated into several different controllers, for example for
the xy-plane and for the z-axis (depth control).
The path is simply a collection of successive poses, as defined below.
\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{nav\_msgs/Path}
\item[topic] \texttt{/global\_plan}
\item[contents] \begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
 std_msgs/Header header
   uint32 seq
   time stamp
   string frame_id
 geometry_msgs/PoseStamped[] poses
   std_msgs/Header header
     uint32 seq
     time stamp
     string frame_id
   geometry_msgs/Pose pose
     geometry_msgs/Point position
       float64 x
       float64 y
       float64 z
     geometry_msgs/Quaternion orientation
       float64 x
       float64 y
       float64 z
       float64 w
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{description}

\subsection{Performance Monitoring}
\label{monitor}

We briefly touch on performance monitoring here, together with some
relevant message types. Similar to the safe depths of Section \ref{planner},
the AUV will also have critical depths/altitude parameters.
If these parameters are exceeded, it may choose to do an emergency ascent,
or take other measures for safety.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Critical altitude} the monitor triggers an emergency ascent when below this altitude \begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{double}
\item[name] \texttt{/critical\_altitude}
\end{description}
\item \textbf{Critical depth} the monitor triggers an emergency ascent when below this water depth \begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{double}
\item[name] \texttt{/critical\_depth}
\end{description}  
\end{itemize}
In addition, by inspecting the health and charge of the battery,
it may also choose to abort the mission.
\begin{description}
\item[type] \texttt{sensor\_msgs/BatteryState}
\item[topic] \texttt{/battery\_state}
\item[contents] \begin{scriptsize}
\begin{verbatim}
 std_msgs/Header header
   uint32 seq
   time stamp
   string frame_id
 float32 voltage
 float32 current
 float32 charge
 float32 capacity
 float32 design_capacity
 float32 percentage
 uint8 power_supply_status
 uint8 power_supply_health
 uint8 power_supply_technology
 bool present
 float32[] cell_voltage
 string location
 string serial_number
\end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{description}

\section{Summary}

We have presented a detailed overview of the components
needed for the SAM base navigation system. It may now
be of interest to look at the reference implementations in
\texttt{gitr.sys.kth.se/smarc-project/sam\_drivers}.
